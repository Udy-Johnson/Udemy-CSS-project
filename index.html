                    <b>Welcome!</b><br> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum isnot simply a random text. It has root in a piece of classical latin literature from 45BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClinktock, a latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                    College in Virginia, looked up one of the most obscured latin words, consectetur, from Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
                    sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extreme of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethnics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
                    Ipsum, "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line of section 1.10.32. The Standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since he 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33from "de Finibus Boorum et Malorum"
                    by Cicero are also reproduved in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                <b>Left Column:<em>230px</em></b><br>It is a long established fact that a reaer will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                of letters as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing package and webpage editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'Lorem Ipsum' will
                uncover many websites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humor and the likes).

                <b>Right Column:<em>230px</em></b><br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
